vacunas contra covid19 como por ejemplo johnson johnson que usa vector ad26 china cansino que emplea ad5 mientras que rusa sputnik utiliza dos vectores adenovirales ad5 ad26 vale pena mencionar que las plataformas para vacunas que usan otros países como vector adenovirus chimpancé oxfordastra zeneca quienes por cierto están estudiando posibilidad aplicar manera conjunta vacuna sputnik para incrementar efectividad tecnología arn pfizerbiontech nunca antes habían sido utilizadas vacunas que hayan pasado fase tampoco han sido sometidas estudios largo plazo sobre sus posibles efectos secundarios cuerpo humano como por ejemplo los riesgos desarrollar complicaciones relacionadas con cáncer sus efectos sobre fertilidad las vacunas arn mensajero pfizerbiontechmoderna mayor preocupación con este tipo vacunas sido inestabilidad baja eficiencia para introducirlas las células que expresen antígeno también preocupado hecho que arn puede estimular reacciones inmunológicas tipo inflamatorio por que todos estos factores han limitado parte desarrollo arn una molécula muy inestable que requiere condiciones mantenimiento extremas menos degrada muy fácilmente por enzimas internaliza forma eficiente sin embargo esta tecnología también tiene ventajas relativamente más barata que otro tipo vacunas sobre todo permite diseñar una vacuna nueva tiempo récord una vez que conoce genoma del patógeno unas semanas pueden producir los primeros prototipos vacunales que convierte una excelente herramienta cuando aparece patógeno nuevo para que necesita una vacuna con urgencia como una pandemia este caso rapidez beneficio mayor que problema inestabilidad moderna fue capaz diseñar vacuna arnm contra sarscov2 tan solo seis semanas después que genoma del virus hiciera público opinión por lado vacuna rusa aprovecha los modelos vacunas probados innova sentido usar dos vectores lugar uno solo modelo que bien tiene efectividad que manifiestan las vacunas arn mensajero más segura términos efectos secundarios adversos igual efectiva que vacunas que todos conocemos hasta ahora que nos hemos aplicado por otro lado pfizer otras apuestan futuro económico puede que esta ocasión tengan tropezones pero avance que van lograr ahorro años investigación aún así como resto las vacunas reto será que mediano largo plazo resulten eficaces que sus efectos adversos sean mínimos para poder compararlas con modelo tradicional vacunas que guste políticos villamelones eficaz seguro conclusión encuentro optimista las vacunas contra covid19 comentadas este texto han demostrado científicamente que podemos seguir confiando ciencia para resolver prevenir problemas salud como las pandemias competencia entre científicos sana provoca desarrollos alternativos que nos permite tener
